// ASSESSMENT 2: Coding practical questions with Jest

// Please read all questions thoroughly
// All problems can be solved with concepts covered in class or in the syllabus
// Pseudo coding is REQUIRED
// If you get stuck, please leave comments to help us understand your thought process

// Add appropriate dependencies to the repository:
// $ yarn add jest

// Use test driven development to complete the following questions
// Run the file with the following command:
// $ yarn jest

// Reminder: The test will call your function

// --------------------1) Create a function that takes a number as an argument and decides if the number is evenly divisble by three or not.

// a) Create a test with expect statements for each of the variables provided.

var num1 = 15
// Expected output: "15 is divisible by three"

var num2 = 0
// Expected output: "0 is divisible by three"

var num3 = -7
// Expected output: "-7 is not divisible by three"



// b) Create the function that makes the test pass.



// --------------------2) Create a function that takes in an array of words and returns an array with all the words capitalized.

// a) Create a test with expect statements for each of the variables provided.

var randomNouns1 = ["streetlamp", "potato", "teeth", "conclusion", "nephew"]
// Expected output: ["Streetlamp", "Potato", "Teeth", "Conclusion", "Nephew"]

var randomNouns2 = ["temperature", "database", "chopsticks", "mango", "deduction"]
// Expected output: ["Temperature", "Database", "Chopsticks", "Mango", "Deduction"]



// b) Create the function that makes the test pass.



// --------------------3) Create a function that takes in a string and logs the index of the first vowel.

// a) Create a test with expect statements for each of the variables provided.

var vowelTester1 = "learn"
// Expected output: 1
var vowelTester2 = "academy"
// Expected output: 0
var vowelTester3 = "challenge"
// Expected output: 2



// b) Create the function that makes the test pass.
